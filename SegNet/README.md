SegNet
This repository contains scripts for the SegNet module, designed to be used with the YOLOv8 architecture for enhanced subcellular structure detection and segmentation in Cell Painting images.

Overview
SegNet is a deep learning-based segmentation network that precisely extracts subcellular structures from Cell Painting images. It is optimized to work alongside the YOLOv8 framework, leveraging its robust architecture for improved performance in various image analysis tasks.

Requirements
Python >= 3.8
PyTorch >= 1.7
YOLOv8 (installation instructions below)

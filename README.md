# CPHNet
CPHNet is a deep learning-based pipeline designed for high-throughput drug screening using Cell Painting images. It focuses on identifying potential therapeutic agents for High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) by analyzing morphological alterations in cellular structures.

##Key Features
###Subcellular Structure Detection: Utilizes advanced segmentation techniques for precise subcellular structure extraction.
###Hypoxia Scoring: Implements a hypoxia scoring network (HypoNet) to assess cellular hypoxia status based on morphological changes.
###High-Throughput Screening: Processes large datasets efficiently, aiding in the discovery of potential HAPE treatments.
###Integration with AI Tools: Combines Cell Painting technology with artificial intelligence for enhanced phenotypic drug discovery.
##Applications
###Drug discovery for conditions like HAPE
###Analysis of morphological changes under hypoxic conditions
###High-throughput screening for potential therapeutic agents
